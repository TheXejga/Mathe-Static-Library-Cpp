# mathe-static-library-cpp
## How do I use it?
It is pretty simple. You have to put the "mathe.h" file in your include folder of your compiler. Then you have to open your IDE and link the library "libmathe.a"
## For what should I use it?
I programmed this just for education. Actually, there is a much better library already implemented in your compiler, that is much better than mine. But I'm still working on it :D
## How do I use the functions and methods?
Just read the "API.txt" file for more information!
